// Natural-language skill activation — KodaX SDK global SkillRegistry wiring.
//
// What this closes: KodaX SDK (`@kodax-ai/kodax/skills` + `/coding`) already
// has all three pieces needed for the model to discover and invoke skills
// from natural-language prompts (no `/skill-name` slash required):
//
//   1. `getSkillRegistry(projectRoot)` — process-global SkillRegistry singleton
//   2. The coding `skill` tool — reads `getSkillRegistry()` at tool-invoke time
//   3. The prompt builder injects `context.skillsPrompt` as a
//      `skills-addendum` section (see KodaX
//      `agent/src/capabilities/skills/skill-registry.ts`
//      `getSystemPromptSnippet()` + `coding/src/prompts/capability-sections.ts`
//      `skills-addendum` branch).
//
// KodaX REPL wires all three (InkREPL: `initializeSkillRegistry(gitRoot)` at
// boot + `getSkillRegistry(gitRoot).getSystemPromptSnippet()` per turn).
// Space previously wired only the explicit `/skill discover|invoke` IPC path
// (apps/desktop/electron/ipc/skill.ts), so RealKodaXSession's runManagedTask
// `options.context` had no `skillsPrompt` — the model saw NO list of skills
// in its system prompt and could not auto-route by intent.
//
// Why we MUST use SDK's global getSkillRegistry (not Space's local
// `apps/desktop/electron/skill/registry.ts` wrapper that does
// `new SkillRegistry(projectRoot)`):
//   The coding `skill` tool's tool body calls `getSkillRegistry()` (no args
//   → returns current global instance). If Space's wrapper creates its own
//   instance but the global is uninitialized, the tool sees zero skills
//   even though the prompt addendum lists them. By going through the
//   global SDK getter we keep "what the model sees" and "what the tool can
//   invoke" in lock-step.
//
// Concurrency model: SDK global SkillRegistry holds ONE `_instance` per
// process and resets it whenever `getSkillRegistry` is called with a
// different `projectRoot` (KodaX `agent/src/capabilities/skills/skill-
// registry.ts:247`). Space supports multiple sessions for different project
// roots in the same Electron main process. Without serialization, two
// concurrent `buildSkillsPrompt` calls for different roots can thrash the
// singleton mid-flight — session A's `getSystemPromptSnippet()` ends up
// reading session B's freshly-reset (and not-yet-discovered) registry,
// silently emitting an empty addendum.
//
// We fix this with a single process-level serializing chain (`inFlight`).
// Every `buildSkillsPrompt` call atomically performs init + snippet-read
// under the lock, so the global state cannot be reset by another session
// between our init and our read. Lock cost is bounded by discover() — a
// few ms for cached `_instance`, tens of ms cold. Acceptable for the
// per-turn user-facing path.
//
// Failure policy: any failure (SDK subpath unreachable, discover throws on
// a broken SKILL.md, etc.) degrades to an empty prompt — the session still
// works, the model just doesn't get the skills addendum. We log to stderr
// but never throw out of the session boot path.

// `import type` keeps this a compile-time-only import — the dynamic
// `import('@kodax-ai/kodax/skills')` below is what actually loads the
// subpath at runtime (CJS-built main can't statically require subpath
// "import"-only conditional exports — same constraint that drove
// `loadSdkCoding` / `loadSdkLlm` in real-session.ts).

 * path (this file) previously advertised EVERY discovered skill, so a skill carrying these tokens
 * could be auto-invoked by the model and run unmediated shell. We enforce the same policy here by
 * setting `disableModelInvocation=true` on any unsafe skill, which the SDK honors in BOTH places:
 *   (a) `getSystemPromptSnippet()` filters `disableModelInvocation` skills out of the prompt, and
 *   (b) the `skill` tool refuses to invoke a skill whose loaded form has the flag set.
 * `loadFull` caches and returns the same Skill reference the tool later reads, so mutating it closes
 * the tool path too. Safe skills are untouched — no regression to the dynamic-context-free majority.
