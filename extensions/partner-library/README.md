# Partner library · Space Extension v1

This is an independently built UI package, not a module imported by the trusted
desktop renderer. The archive contains exactly `manifest.json` and a
self-contained `ui/index.html`. Version 0.5.1 retains the writing mentor and
eight scene experts: document processing, research, data analysis, presentations,
finance, product management, design, and email editing. Their persistent role
prompts are separate from the original task templates, which remain starter tasks.
No built-in expert configures a Skill by default. This version declares the
Feishu connector (displayed as `飞书`), backed by the trusted host's supported `feishu-cli`
adapter. A declaration is not a connected account. The package does not include
or install Skills, authenticate CLI accounts, or receive credentials/documents.

## Build

From the repository root:

```sh
npm run build:packages
node scripts/build-partner-extension.mjs
```

The default output is `out/extensions/kodax.partner-library-0.5.1.space-extension`.
Use `--out-dir <directory>` for another artifact directory. The archive is a ZIP;
the builder computes the HTML SHA-256 and replaces the placeholder from the
source manifest in the archive only.

Install the archive through Space's extension manager, then explicitly enable
it. Installation neither executes the UI nor connects services. Disable removes
the UI contribution; uninstall removes only this package and its registration,
not conversation history, user documents, or existing Skills.

Version 0.5.1 changes only the connector's horizontal card and brand presentation.
It retains `kodax.partner-library` / `feishu-docs` / `feishu-cli`, so updating and
explicitly re-enabling the package does not require disconnecting or reconnecting
existing accounts. This rename does not grant access to additional Feishu products
or rewrite saved conversation snapshots. The official logo is embedded as a data
URL for offline loading under the existing frame CSP; its source and ownership
are recorded in [brand assets](../../resources/brands/README.md).

The v1 loader accepts host API version 1, a fixed `ui/index.html` entry, at most
2 MiB of HTML, a 64 KiB manifest, and a 4 MiB archive. Paths, entry types, duplicate
names, compression ratios, compatibility, and the HTML hash are validated. The
hash is integrity checking, **not publisher authentication**. Third-party UI
requires the host's isolation and trust disclosure; it does not receive the
trusted renderer's IPC bridge or an SDK code-extension runtime.

The host expert catalog reads only enabled packages whose installed manifest and
HTML still pass integrity checks. Selecting an expert resolves its exact revision
into a session snapshot. Updating the package does not silently rewrite an
existing snapshot's prompt or revision. Disabling/uninstalling the package or
removing that expert makes the old binding unavailable. An optional `skillRef`
is only a reference to an existing Skill, not an installer or permission grant.
An explicit `useSkill` selection is preserved in the snapshot as data; this
catalog never loads, searches, installs, or substitutes Skills.

User-authored experts are stored separately under
`<Space data directory>/extension-data/<extensionId>/experts.json`. Editing a
built-in creates a new `user.<uuid>` copy; editing a user expert requires its
expected revision and increments that revision. Deletes retain the latest
definition with a tombstone and remove it from availability. Earlier role
versions remain in their existing conversation snapshots, not a separate history
engine. Upgrade, disable, and uninstall do not delete this user data, and reinstall
does not resurrect tombstoned experts. Each extension is limited to 128 total
user records (including tombstones) and 1 MiB of UTF-8 data; capacity, conflicts,
and invalid files fail explicitly without overwriting existing content.

Registry publication is the install/uninstall commit point. Unsafe existing
bundle paths fail validation before that commit. If cleanup later fails, the
committed result remains authoritative and a diagnostic warning identifies the
unregistered bundle; its files may remain but cannot supply an active view or
expert. No broader directory cleanup or user-data deletion is attempted.

## Verification and TDD record

```sh
node --test --import tsx apps/desktop/electron/space-extensions/*.test.ts
node --test scripts/test/build-partner-extension.test.mjs
```

The public lifecycle test was first run with no store module and failed
(`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`); the minimal install/enable/disable/reopen/uninstall
implementation then made it pass. The build test likewise failed with a missing
builder before the independent archive builder was implemented.

Further store tests were added and run RED, then implemented and run GREEN one
at a time: extra executable files, duplicate ZIP names, symbolic-link entries,
oversized HTML, compression bombs, replaced on-disk symlinks, redirected package
directories, non-Space archive suffixes, excessive ZIP entries, UTF-8 BOM
preservation, and recovery after a bundle directory was removed.

Additional public-contract regressions cover malformed/unsupported manifests,
missing entry files, content tampering, traversal paths, upgrade rollback,
serialized concurrent operations, preserved unrelated data, and a real
build → install → enable → read-view → uninstall round trip.

The expert catalog test first failed because its module did not exist, then
passed with enabled-only listing and exact-revision resolution. Additional
RED → GREEN cases cover an edited installed manifest and an oversized registry
created by multiple expert catalogs. Snapshot-preservation, unavailable bindings,
data-only Skill references, and lazy shared runtime construction are also tested.
Real filesystem tests reproduced the update/uninstall post-commit cleanup failure
using read-only bundle directories; their committed results now remain usable
and cleanup failures produce diagnostics. A separate symlink test verifies that
pre-commit validation failures still reject updates without changing registration.

P3 public catalog tests were run RED → GREEN for creation, built-in copies, user
revision updates, tombstone deletion, concurrent revision conflicts, explicit
Skill preference preservation, record and byte limits, and duplicate stored
identities. Regression tests additionally verify isolation between extensions,
disabled-package rejection, upgrade/uninstall/reinstall retention, root/directory/
file symlink rejection, malformed input preservation, and atomic-write failure
recovery. The archive migration test first rejected the old one-expert package,
then verified all eight stable scene IDs, descriptions and original starter tasks
alongside the unchanged writing mentor in the 0.3.0 package.

These are archive, store, and expert-catalog tests. They do not establish that the
whole F146 feature or the interactive Electron install/select/send flow is complete.

## Feishu connector host boundary (P4/P5)

The package frame can only request `connector.catalog` and `connector.configure`.
It cannot provide an extension/session identity, obtain tokens, read documents,
change global policy, or approve writes. Configuration opens the trusted Space
connection dialog. The 0.5.0 host adds explicit private installation of official
CLI 1.0.92 and a cancellable first-connection flow through official Feishu pages.
Merely opening the library or dialog cannot install, start authorization or bind
an account. Existing CLI profiles remain available through the advanced account
option; creating a new connection uses a distinct Space-owned profile and preserves
existing profile entries and the default selection. Credentials remain owned by
the official CLI: choosing an existing app on Feishu's website may share its
app/user credential storage with other profiles. The package frame receives only connected connector
IDs for its status indicators, never account details or authorization links.

The trusted panel separates account connection from per-conversation selection.
Users select exact `https://<tenant>.feishu.cn/docx/<id>` links with read or
read-plus-append scope, and optionally an exact folder URL for new documents.
The composer connection menu enables/disables each account for this conversation
without changing drafts or sending messages. A newly enabled account may have an
empty document scope; that is not permission to read the user's entire Drive.
The existing right-hand document-scope panel remains the place to grant access.
The existing global connector-write policy remains off unless explicitly changed
in the trusted confirmation dialog. Enabling it affects all connectors but does
not bypass account permissions, document scopes or individual write approvals.

Reads appear in the existing 资料 card as immutable remote snapshots. Proposed
create/append content appears in 待审核; its complete content, target, operation
and version are shown before a host confirmation submits the exact content hash.
Only verified successes appear in 成果 as remote receipts. Unknown/partial or
submitting records cannot be retried; conflicts require rereading and proposing
again. Remote records never masquerade as local file paths or local deliveries.

Renderer tests cover strict frame messages, selection/draft coordination,
no-partial expert/connector create ACKs, scope switching, complete new-dialog
reset, exact-hash confirmation, no uncertain retries, card projections, and the
actual independent HTML. A real browser component fixture additionally verifies
profile-connect versus session-select, policy cancellation/confirmation, draft
preservation, and a late read after switching projects. These are isolated fake
host tests, not a claim that a user's real Feishu account has been authenticated
or a real remote document has been written.

The first-connection contract, cancellation and private-install boundaries are
documented in [F146 onboarding](../../docs/features/f146-feishu-onboarding.md).
Cancelling stops local waiting; it does not revoke consent already granted on
Feishu's website. Disconnecting makes the Space account binding unavailable,
without logging out another app or deleting CLI credentials and remote documents.
